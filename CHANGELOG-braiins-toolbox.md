# Changelog — Braiins Toolbox

Notable changes to the **Braiins Toolbox** Umbrel app, newest first. The
version number is the upstream Toolbox version (`version` in
`braiins-braiins-toolbox/umbrel-app.yml`), optionally with a `-N` wrapper
revision suffix for packaging-only releases (e.g. `26.06-1`).

Each upstream entry is the release description from the public release feed —
the same text shown as the in-app update notes. This file keeps the history,
since the manifest's `releaseNotes` only ever holds the current version and is
overwritten on each bump. Entries are added automatically by
`.github/scripts/bump.py` via the [`toolbox-update`](.github/workflows/toolbox-update.yml)
and [`toolbox-wrapper-release`](.github/workflows/toolbox-wrapper-release.yml)
workflows.
